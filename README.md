<h1 align="center">Howdy! I'm Kevin</h1>

### About me
- MASc student at the [Ontario Tech University](https://ontariotechu.ca/) (formerly UOIT). My academic and research interests are deterministic radiation transport, reactor physics and methods development in nuclear engineering.
- I bounce between various projects, including a graphics engine written in OpenGL (Strontium) and my masters research (GNAT).
- I'm currently learning graphics programming (Vulkan) and finite element methods for radiation transport.
 
### Projects
- [Strontium](https://github.com/ksawatzky777/Strontium): My own OpenGL graphics/game engine. 
- CARIBOU: A multiphysics transport code for the environmental assessment of nuclear accidents.
- GNAT: A neutron transport and activation subapp for CARIBOU. Name is still a work in progress!
