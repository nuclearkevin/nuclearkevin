<h1 align="center">Howdy! I'm Kevin</h1>

### About me
- I am a Masters of Applied Science (MASc) student at the [Ontario Tech University](https://ontariotechu.ca/) (formerly UOIT). 
- I'm interested in deterministic radiation transport, nuclear reactor physics, radiation shielding, and the application of the finite element method to problems found in the domain of nuclear engineering.
